		<h2 id="gateleg-table">Contemporary Gateleg Dining Table</h2>
			<p>
				This table lends contemporary design to the traditional form of a gateleg table. The legs are a bent lamination of white oak, shaped to a taper on the back side, and curved in cross-section on the front. The top is white ash, burned to char the wood, then hand scraped to reveal the pattern of the wood grain.
			</p>
			<p>
				The construction is traditional throughout: mortise and tenon joinery holds the table together. The gate legs pivot around a knuckle joint and the leaves swing downward on a rule joint.
			</p>

		<h2 id="federal-clock">Federal Period Shelf Clock Reproduction</h2>
			<p>
				This piece is a reproduction of a late 18th century piece by David Wood. The original is in the collection of the <a href="http://museumcollection.winterthur.org/single-record.php?recid=1957.1092">Winterthur Museum</a>. I created full-sized plans for the piece, working from photos available online and in print. I have adapted the dimensions to fit a commercially-available movement, but the proportions remain largely true to the original.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of particular interest are the finials. I was unable to source finials matching the original from my usual suppliers of hardware. I turned a wooden pattern of the original finials, and brought it to a local jeweler to have it cast in brass. I also reproduced the inlay banding to match that on the original.

		<h2 id="arts-crafts-chairs">Arts-and-Crafts style dining chairs</h2>
			<p>
				This piece is based on an original by <a href="https://www.kevinrodel.com/showroom/item/dining-chair">Kevin Rodel</a>. Fine Woodworking magazine published plans in <a href="https://www.finewoodworking.com/2007/03/01/arts-and-crafts-side-chair">Issue #190</a>. I modified the original design, adding rake to the rear legs and widening the curved splat. I also adapted the joinery to use traditional mortise and tenon joinery, rather than floating tenon joinery as published in Fine Woodworking.

		<h2 id="blanket-chest">Shaker-style blanket chest</h2>
			<p>
			The United Society of Believers, popularly known as the Shakers, originated in England and fled to the United States to escape religious persecution. Today, their best-known legacy is the minimally adorned, but tastefully proportioned furniture they made. Recognized by some as one of the first modern furniture styles, Shaker furniture influenced the post war designers of the Danish Modern style.
			</p>
			<p>
			This piece isn't a reproduction of any particular Shaker original, but the proportions and construction are true to a 2/3rds scale miniature chest built at the Pleasant Hill Shaker Village in Kentucky. I scaled the dimensions up to a full-sized chest. I lined the chest with aromatic cedar to protect the blankets inside.

		<h2 id="collaborative-pin-box">Collaborative Project</h2>
			<p>
				I am a member of the Woodworkers Guild at the Lexington Arts and Crafts Society. This both provides me access to a larger shop than my own and opportunities to work with other members of the Society. The Society organized a collaborative show, pairing up members of different guilds to design and build pieces.
			</p>
			<p>
				I worked with a metalworker; she designed a brooch, and I designed a box that the brooch mounts on. The intent of the piece is that either half can be used independently, but that the two together complement each other when assembled. The piece sold at the gallery show in February 2019.
			</p>
			<p>
				The box is made primarily of walnut, carefully cut and assembled to showcase the spalting in the sapwood. The accents are rosewood veneer and ebony.

		<h2 id="small-boxes">Small boxes</h2>
			<p>
				Designing and building small boxes both provides me both an outlet for experimenting with new techniques, and also gives me an opportunity to refine my building process to accommodate boxes of varying sizes. Each time I build one, I strive to do so more accurately and quickly than before.
